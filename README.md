# Quick demo of Prisma WASM engine + Remix issues

> This is just a straight simple build using the starter template generated by running `npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/cloudflare-workers`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pnpm i
    ```

2. Create a new Postgres database from https://db-provision.cloud.prisma.io, and copy its connection string.

3. Create a local `.dev.vars` file, and paste the connection string into it:
    ```sh
    echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://..." > .dev.vars
    ```

4. Create a local `.env` file (used only by `prisma` CLI), and paste again the connection string into it:
    ```sh
    echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://..." > .env
    ```

5. Push the Prisma schema to the database:
    ```sh
    npx prisma db push
    ```

6. Run the worker locally:
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```

7. Navigate to http://localhost:8788. You should see a message like:

> Hello world - DB fetch was successful and we saw 0 users

## Deploy

Run `pnpm run deploy`.
Remember to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Cloudflare Workers dashboard.

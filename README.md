# Quick demo of Prisma WASM engine + Remix issues

This is just a straight simple build using the starter template generated by running `npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/cloudflare-workers`

---

##Â Setup

1. Install dependencies:
  ```sh
  pnpm i
  ```

2. Create a new Neon database from https://neon.tech, and copy its connection string.

3. Create a local `.dev.vars` file, and paste the connection string into it:
  ```sh
  echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://..." > .dev.vars
  ```

4. Run the worker locally:
  ```sh
  pnpm dev
  ```

5. Navigate to http://localhost:8788. You should see a message like:

> Hello world - DB fetch was successful and we saw 0 users

## Deploy

Run `pnpm run deploy`.
Remember to configure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Cloudflare Workers dashboard.
